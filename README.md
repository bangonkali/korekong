# Korekong

## What is the purpose of this program?

This program will recursively search a directory and create MP4 files from MKV files. 

## How the conversion works?

When an MKV file is found, this program picks out the first Audio, the first Video and all properly named Subtitles and creates a MP4 file out of them. The audio track is encoded as [AAC](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/codec-support.html#audio-compatibilityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicomparisonofvideocontainerformatsaudiocodingformatssupport-wikipedias-audio-codec-tables), the video track as [H.264](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/codec-support.html#video-compatibilityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicomparisonofvideocontainerformats-wikipedias-video-codec-tables) and the subtitles as [mov_text](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FFMPEG_An_Intermediate_Guide/subtitle_options#Set_Subtitle_Codec).

## Why did I make this program?

I wanted a tool to automatically convert all my `MKV` video files in to something that my phone, or for uploading to Youtube. It turns out that [H.264](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/codec-support.html#video-compatibilityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicomparisonofvideocontainerformats-wikipedias-video-codec-tables) and [AAC](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/codec-support.html#audio-compatibilityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicomparisonofvideocontainerformatsaudiocodingformatssupport-wikipedias-audio-codec-tables) are very well supported formats.

## How to use?

```bash
brew install ffmpeg # You only need to do this once!
korekong -d "path/to/directory"
```

The MP4 files will be created beside the location of MKV files with only the extension name that is different. 

If there is already an MP4 file beside the MKV file that has the same name, then a conversion will not be started for that MKV file to avoid overwriting the existing MP4 File.
